Solidar is a calculator to find out the optimal number of solar panels
to install on the roof of a building,
given the features of the roof and the energy use of the residents.

It takes data like the dimensions of the roof, its tilt and orientaion,
the energy use and the electric fare,
and, then, generates a report with the proposed a number of panels,
their economic cost and estimations the eventual savings.
