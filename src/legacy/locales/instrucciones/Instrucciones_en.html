Instructions for use of the individual photovoltaic production simulator </span></b></p>
<h3> Step 1- Localización:</h3>
<p>In this first step we must identify the areas in which photovoltaic panels can be installed. </p>
<p>By scrolling on the map you can locate the area of interest with the help of the location fields or if you know them by directly entering the latitude, longitude coordinates in the corresponding field. </p>
<p>Once you have visualized the working area, you must draw the areas, at least one, in which the panels can be installed. </p>
<p>The area will close automatically when you double-click</p>
<p>Once the area is defined, you will see that a row appears in the table below the map in which you have the data of the defined area. Now we will proceed to finish configuring the details of it</p>
<li>Name: In the case of more than one base it is convenient to assign them a name since the application will assign panels to each of them and show that assignment based on the name. </li>
<li>Roof inclination: If the panels are installed on a roof here you can indicate the angle of the roof with respect to the horizontal of the place. </li>
<li>Panel inclination: This is the angle at which the panels measured from the roof will be installed. </li>
<li>Optimal inclination: In case you want the application to calculate the optimal inclinations, check this box and do not enter any value in the previous fields. </li>
<li>Orientation: In this field we will indicate the orientation that the panels will have with respect to the geographical south. As soon as you position yourself in the field you will see that a line appears on the map that allows you to indicate what is the possible orientation of the panels taking into account the conditions of the roof. </li>
<li>Optimal angles: If you want the application to calculate all the optimal angles check this box and all the previous ones will be ignored</li>
<p>Once defined the location and configuration of the base where the panels will be installed you can give the arrow "Next" to pass the next step. </p>

<h3>Step 2 - Consumption data:</h3>
<p>Now we will proceed to define the consumption profile and the current rate of the contract with the electricity company from the table. </p>
<li>Identification of consumption: Here you can give a name to the point of consumption that you are defining. </li>
<li>Source: There are two ways to define the consumption profile.
<ul><li>If you have a CSV file with hourly consumption obtained from your distribution company, select the option (Individual consumption file) in which case you must identify the file in the "Hours consumption file" field</li>
<li>If you do not have it, use the REE standard profile option. In this case you must enter the annual consumption of the site in the field "Annual consumption"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>You'll see a colored map with your consumption profile. By clicking on it you can see the consumption profile of a specific day. </p>
<li>Selection of the type of tariff (2.0TD or 3.0TD) to be used in the simulation. <br>
Once the rate has been selected, the application proposes prices. SOM Energia are initially proposed. If
they are not the correct ones they can be updated to the values that are appropriate before performing the calculation. </li>
<p>Once this point is reached, you can click on the "Next" button</p>

<h3>Step 3 - Energy Balance</h3>
<p> In this tab you will see the results of the first proposal made by the system. In this case the panel assignment criterion is:
<li>Define a sufficient number of panels to generate the energy necessary to cover a year's consumption. </li>
<li>Verify that the available surface area in the bases defined in step 1 are enough to generate that energy. If they are not, a warning is displayed. </li>
<li>Assign panels to the bases giving priority to the most efficient bases from the point of view of energy performance</li>
<p>In the rest of the tab you can see a set of data of interest obtained from this configuration</p>
<p>At this time it may be interesting that you look at the rest of the tabs to evaluate the situation and before deciding to change the number of panels or the individaul power of them. </p>
<p>In any case from this tab you can change the panels assigned to each base according to your own criteria. Solidar will verify that you can not put more panels than accepted by the area defined in step 1 for each base. </p>
<h3>Step 4 - Economic Balance</h3>
<p>Here you can see what is the result from the economic and financial point of view of the installation of the panels defined in step 3. </p>
<p>It is important to highlight some fields in this tab:</p>
<li>The annual expenditure, with or without panels and therefore the savings, is highly conditioned by the rates defined in step 2 of consumption</li>
<li>Given the price volatility and variations detected by region, it is very difficult to estimate a price of the installation. We propose one with the estimates we have but the correct thing is that you consult with an installer. You can correct the price that we propose by indicating a positive percentage to increase the price or negative to decrease it in the field "Price correction in %"</li>
<p>With the data defined above, the application will show a financial table with the study of the expected return on investment</p>
<p>For this table it is essential to define in the fields shown for this purpose if there is any type of subsidy to apply from Next Generation funds or the reduction of the IBI applied by some municipalities. </p>
<h3>5 - Graphics</h3>
<p> In this tab you can see some graphs that show the monthly behavior of the proposed system</p>
<h3>6 - Summary</h3>
<p>A summary of all variables entered and calculated for this simulation is displayed</p>
<p>Multiple test cycles can be done by changing installation settings &lt;Panels&gt; or &lt;Power by panel&gt;. This change can be made from the &lt;Balance energy&gt;. The application will perform the corresponding calculations in an automatic way.</p>
<p>On the Parameters screen , which is activated from the tools icon, you can update various parameters used in the calculation. The changes made to this tab will be reflected in the next calculation. </p>
<p>From the menu at the top right you can select the following options, from left to right:</span></p>
